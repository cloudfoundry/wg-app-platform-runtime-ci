    .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack

    Cloud Native Applications are expected to bring in configurations from external sources like environment variables, config server, etc.

    In applications that run on IIS (e.g. ASP.NET), configuration settings are injected through Web.config files. As per cloud native principles, configuration should stay out of build artifacts. This extension buildpack provides a solution to this problem by using token replacement during â€˜cf pushâ€™ staging.
