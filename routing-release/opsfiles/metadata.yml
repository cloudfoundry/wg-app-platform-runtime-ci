  This directory contains the opsfiles needed for routing-release.
opsfiles:
  disable-bbr-non-routing.yml: Disables backups for components that aren't routing. We use this when running drats to only test our components, and cut down on time.
  disable-route-emitter-tls-tcp-routes.yml: Disables route-emitter from advertising TCP routes with TLS support
  enable-route-emitter-tls-tcp-routes.yml: Enables route-emitter to advertise TCP routes with TLS support
  disable-rep-unproxied-ports.yml: Disables unproxied port mappings for containers (forces traffic through envoy)
  enable-rep-unproxied-ports.yml: Enables unproxied port mappings for containers (traffic can bypass envoy)
  disable-envoy-mtls.yml: Disables envoy's mTLS support, relying on one-way TLS instead
  enable-envoy-mtls.yml: Forces envoy to require mTLS when connecting to it, to lock down access to just gorouter/tcp-router/diego-ssh
  disable-tcp-router-tls.yml: Disables tcp-router from supporting TLS on TCP routes
  enable-tcp-router-tls.yml: Enables tcp-router to handle TLS on TCP routes
  add-tcp-router-backend-tls-certs.yml: Adds TLS cert configs to tcp-router
