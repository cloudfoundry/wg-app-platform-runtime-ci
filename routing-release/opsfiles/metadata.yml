readme:
  This directory contains the opsfiles needed for routing-release.
opsfiles:
  add-lb-ca-cert.yml: Required for resolving route services hosted on the platform. Gives gorouter the LB CA cert so it trusts requests coming from inside the platform.
  disable-bbr-non-routing.yml: Disables backups for components that aren't routing. We use this when running drats to only test our components, and cut down on time.
