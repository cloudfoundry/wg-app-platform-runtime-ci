  This task will update a given config for bosh. A set of default vars will be provided for the manifest. See bosh-helpers.bash file for `bosh_extract_manifest_defaults_from_cf` function.
extra_inputs:
  release-*: (Optional) Generic release (git resource) to be created in manifest. Manifest can have `version:create` with variable path. The content in this release can then be mapped via ENV variable.
  ci-config: (Optional) if ci config files needs to be provided from a repo other than this. This would be used when using a private-repo to hold ci configurations
  repo: (optional) specifies the boshrelease repo to use (required when SKIP_DEFAULT_VAR_GENERATION is false)
oses:
  - linux
params:
  ENVS: Multiline envs that can be defined dynamically and loaded into the bosh deploy vars without having to create more params. Values set here would then be available as a VARS to bosh deploy command. It's also possible to run a single line command for extracting VARS that would only be available when targeting env. e.g. DEPLOYMENT_GOROUTER_IP=$(bosh -d cf vms --json | jq -r ".Tables[].Rows[] | select(.instance | startswith(\"router\")) | .ips" | head -n1)
  NAME: Bosh Config Name
  RUNTIME_CONFIG: Path to runtime-config yml file

  SKIP_DEFAULT_VAR_GENERATION: whether or not to skip default variable generation (for use when updating a config that doesn't have a CF already deployed)
  BBL_STATE_DIR: path inside the `env` input to the bbl state directory (optional)
