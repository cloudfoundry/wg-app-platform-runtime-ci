  Runs linting for a specified repo. The implementation for each linter is located within linters directory for the CI repo under repo's remote name e.g. ci/{routing-release}/linters/sync-package-specs.bash. This script will be called with 2 arguments.
  1st-Argument -> path to where repo is located
  2nd-Argument -> Whether it should error on detecting failures or not (true or false). In some tasks we take advantage of sync-package-specs script to automatically bump go-mod-dependencies, so that changes can be committed. For backward compatibility we are keeping the same behavior.
  match-golang-os-package-versions.bash -> Make sure golang version for linux & windows package is the same.
extra_inputs:
  ci-config: (Optional) if ci config files needs to be provided from a repo other than this. This would be used when using a private-repo to hold ci configurations
oses:
  - linux
params:
  DEFAULT_PARAMS: Path to .yml file containing repo's default-params to use instead. If this value is set, it will override other params set explicitly.
  LINTERS: (Defaults to 
    sync-package-specs.bash
    sync-submodule-config.bash
    match-golang-os-package-versions.bash
    ) Mulitline list of linters to run within the release
