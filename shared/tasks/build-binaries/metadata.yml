  This task will build-binaries using helper FUNCTIONS defined dynamically. For each platfrom, this is accomplished by using (bash or powershell) functions defined at the release level that know how to build binaries for that release. The goal is to centralized building process of binaries for all concourse tasks within the release that defines them so that we don't have different ways of building. `built-binaries` will contain the output of binaries.
extra_inputs:
  ci-config: (Optional) if ci config files needs to be provided from a repo other than this. This would be used when using a private-repo to hold ci configurations for params.
oses:
  - linux
  - windows
params:
  DEFAULT_PARAMS: (Currently works on Linux only) Path to .yml file containing repo's default-params to use instead. If this value is set, it will override other params set explicitly.
  FUNCTIONS: Multiline parameter that accepts path to (powershell/bash) scripts that define functions to be used. e.g. ci/winc-release/helpers/configure-binaries.ps1
  ENVS: |
    (Currently works on Linux Only). This parameter defines a list of environment variables will be loaded at runtime, as opposed to
    container-creation time. The purpose here is to allow users to extend the list of environment
    variables used by the task simply by updating the pipeline config, rather than by updating the task definition
    in linux.yml.
  MAPPING: Multiline parameter that defines maps function call to code containing source. e.g. Build-Gdn=src/guardian/cmd/gdn
