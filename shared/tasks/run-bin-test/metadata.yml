  This task will run respective `./bin/test{.bash,ps1}` for different OSes.
  In order to to make this task more generalized by setting up env variables and defining functions for the actual test,
  it will source FUNCTIONS and ENVS defined within the task before calling the respective test file.
extra_inputs:
  built-binaries: (Optional) This will optionally take built-binaries (chained with build-binaries task) that have corresponding source files (run.ps1/run.bash) to be used at runtime.
  input-*: |
    (Optional) Generic inputs for passing in config files or files needed to run the test.
    Any param defined below can reference files in this input. e.g. CONFIG=$PWD/input-01/config.json
oses:
  - linux
  - windows
params:
  DB: (Currently works on linux only). Set DB flavor to configure for tests. e.g. postgres, mysql
  DEFAULT_PARAMS: Path to .yml file containing repo's default-params to use instead. If this value is set, it will override other params set explicitly.
  DIR: Path to where you can run `./bin/test{.bash,ps1}`. This is helpful to use when using submodule pattern and wanting to test internal repos without having to create more resources.
  ENVS: |
    This parameter defines a list of environment variables will be loaded at runtime, as opposed to
    container-creation time. The purpose here is to allow users to extend the list of environment
    variables used by the task simply by updating the pipeline config, rather than by updating the task definition
    in linux.yml or windows.yml.
  FLAGS: |
    (Ginkgo Defaults are
      --keep-going
      --trace
      -r
      --fail-on-pending
      --randomize-all
      -p
      --race
      --timeout 20m
    ) Multiline flags to call test with. If running against a non-go project, this needs to be overridden
  FUNCTIONS:  Multiline functions to be used for extra configuration of binaries. e.g. ci/winc-release/helpers/configure-binaries.{ps1,bash}
  RUN_AS: User to run tests as - defaults to root. If overridden, chowns all of the build directory + inputs to that user, then runs tests as that user. Only used on Linux.
  VERIFICATIONS: |
    (Defaults to
      Verifying if go exists
      Verifying if go version matches with bosh's package # when ran against repositories that are not bosh release, it will skip this check
      Verifying if go fmt is passing
      Verifying if go vet is passing
    ) Verify helper functions to run for a give test.
