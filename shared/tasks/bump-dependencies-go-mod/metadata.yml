  This task bump dependencies for a go project with go.mod
extra_inputs:
  built-binaries: (Optional) This will optionally take built-binaries (chained with build-binaries task) that have corresponding source files (run.ps1/run.bash) to be used at runtime.
  dep-local-repo-replace-*: (Optional) Generic input to use when go.mod has a local import path
oses:
  - linux
params:
  GOOS: unset and will default to the OS that's running under
  GO_MODS: Multiline path for go.mods e.g. src/code.cloudfoundry.org/go.mod
  REPLACE_DIRECTIVES: Create a local directory mapping for values set here so that local go.mod dirs can resolve. e.g. dep-local-repo-replace-01:garden
  FUNCTIONS:  Multiline functions to be used for extra configuration of binaries. e.g. ci/winc-release/helpers/configure-binaries.{ps1,bash}
  EXTRA_GO_TAGS: Extra go tag to run go mod vendor and go mod tidy with e.g. tools
  ENVS: |
    (Currently works on Linux Only). This parameter defines a list of environment variables will be loaded at runtime, as opposed to
    container-creation time. The purpose here is to allow users to extend the list of environment
    variables used by the task simply by updating the pipeline config, rather than by updating the task definition
    in linux.yml.
