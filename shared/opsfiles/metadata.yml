  This directory contains the shared opsfiles needed for the Application Runtime Working Group.
opsfiles:
  add-lb-ca-cert.yml: Required for resolving route services hosted on the platform. This is needed for running route_services tests.
  add-smoke-tests.yml: Configures the CF smoke tests. Required for running CF smoke tests. Enables isolation segment smoke tests. Required for running CF smoke tests.
  scale-for-cats.yml: This is used for testing with a cf-deployment pooled env. They are provisioned pretty light, so we need to scale them up. Otherwise, CATS becomes very flakey. Adds diego cells and increase their size.
  scale-to-HA.yml: This is used to scale up every instance to a high-availibity (HA) installation
  scale-down-for-bosh-lite.yml: BBL BOSH-Lites don't come with a `large` vm type which we specify in scale-for-cats.yml. This downgrades it to `medium`, since vm_type is irrelevant on bosh-lite
  compiled-windows-windows-runtime-workaround.yml: A workaround to enable compiled-releases to not be recompiled when Windows VMs are present
