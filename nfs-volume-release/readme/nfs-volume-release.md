# SMB-Volume Release

This repository is a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release for
deploying smbbroker and smbdriver to provision preexisting shares and bind the shares to your applications for share file access.

For information on getting started with Cloud Foundry look at the docs for
[CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).
