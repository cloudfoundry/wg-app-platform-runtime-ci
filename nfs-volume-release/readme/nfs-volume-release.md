# NFS-Volume Release

This repository is a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release for
deploying nfsbroker and nfsv3driver to provision existing NFS volumes and bind those volumes to your applications for shared file access.

Additionally, `nfstestserver` and `nfstestldapserver` jobs  provide a server for tests to target with which you can try out volume mounts.

For information on getting started with Cloud Foundry look at the docs for
[CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).
