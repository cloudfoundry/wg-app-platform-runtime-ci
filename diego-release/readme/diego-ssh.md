# Diego SSH

Diego-ssh is an implementation of an ssh proxy server and a lightweight ssh
daemon that supports command execution, secure file copies via `scp`, and
secure file transfer via `sftp`. When deployed and configured correctly, these
provide a simple and scalable way to access containers associated with Diego
long running processes.
